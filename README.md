# React Typescript Demos

This project is mostly just me (shawnpflueger) going through various React demos from the [React Docs](https://reactjs.org)
and attempting to piece them together using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) instead of Javascript. 
Hamstrung by both the fact that the docs are all written with just Javascript in mind
and also I was only using Notepad++ for all of it which has no built in Typescript support. 
So I basically just used some clues from the Typescript compilers and how React was behaving to figure things out.
Then I found this helpful resource: https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react#reacttypescript-cheatsheets

# Demos

As of this writing the repository basically consists of 7 demonstration items.

## Clock

This should show on every page and is implemented inside the App.tsx file. 
It was pulled/inspired by the [Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/renderings-elements.html) documentation.
I thought it would be neat to try out the timer functionality and have something relatively static on the page as you go through the various demos.

# Getting Started with Create React App

Bootstrapped using yarn with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) --typescript.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
